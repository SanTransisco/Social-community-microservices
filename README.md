# cpsc449-proj1-microservices
The goal of this software was to make a set of web services that would facilitate the creation of a social media site much like reddit. Using Microservices we split up the various services of such a social media site to two services: Posting and voting. Creating the services in this way allows the web service to scales easier, as each instance of the service is isolate from the other so to scale up all we need to do is start up more posting or voting processes.

# Contributions:
- Lambert and Shijie own development and testing of the posting microservice, BFF recent functionalities, xml generation
- San and Kailie own development and testing of the voting microservice, BFF top and hot functionalities
- All group member own the procfile, WSGI server, load balancer, and Tuffix deployment

# Deploying multiple instances of the posts and voting microservice using load-balancing
1. Rename `env.txt` to `.env` to setup the deployment environment
2. Start DynamoDB on your computer open a command prompt window,
navigate to the directory where you extracted DynamoDBLocal.jar, and enter the following command.
```
$ java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
```
3.Then open another terminal instance in the project folder and run foreman
```
$ foreman start -c
```
4. Open yet another terminal instance and type the command:
```
$ ulimit -n 8192 && caddy
```
5. IN YET ANOTHER terminal instance type the command:
```
$ flask run
```
We are under the belief that we can run the BFF as another set of microservices using foreman.
However, for the sake of not having this potentially blow up we will run it using flask.
6. And open the last instance of the terminal, and type the command:
```
$ python3 test.py
```
Also to keep the screen clutter down I opted to not display some json data.
If you wish to see the json data type
```
$ python3 test.py -v
```
